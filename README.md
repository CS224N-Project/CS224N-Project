# CS224N-Project

## Description

Reimplementation and experimentation with the ideas presented in [Rationalizing Neural Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04155). This project seeks to perform multi-sentiment analysis on free-form text data. In addition, the model provides an extract from the original text on why it predicted the sentiment it did. In essence, it predicts sentiement accurately and provides a rationale for why it predicted the way it did.
